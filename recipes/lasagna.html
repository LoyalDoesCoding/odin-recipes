    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty made from scratch tomato sauce and a tasty cheesy filling. A more traditional filling would be made with ricotta, but this one calls for a blend of small curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. Served best with a leafy green salad, and some garlic bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>8oz can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>28oz can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of parsley </li>
        <li>1 crushed garlic clove</li>
        <li>A dash of sugar</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 lb cottage cheese</li>
        <li>16 oz shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded Parmesan</li>
        <li>3 large Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to prepare:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
